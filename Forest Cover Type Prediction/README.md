# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction

The problem statement revolves around the need to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data).

It includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type.

## About the dataset

A zipped file containing the following items is given:

train.csv The data file train.csv contains the 9072 instances with the 56 features including the target feature.

test.csv The datafile test.csv contains the 6048instances with the 55 features excluding the target feature.

sample_submission.csv Explained under the Submission sub-heading

FCDataDictionary.csv The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the forest cover dataset

## Outcomes

The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practise and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to try out different preprocessing and feature selection techniques and apply different models of your choice and tune them until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

EDA & Data Preprocessing Feature Selection Model Building and hyperparameter tuning After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to how to work on a dataset end to end and the different strategies you can use to increase the evaluation metric.
